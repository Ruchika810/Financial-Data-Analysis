# 📈 Financial Data Analysis & Forecasting

Analyze historical financial market data and forecast future stock prices using Python-based time series models and visualizations.

---

## 📊 Project Objectives

- Analyze stock price trends over time  
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on financial data  
- Apply time series forecasting using statistical & machine learning models  
- Visualize performance using interactive charts and trend indicators

---

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies Used

- 🐍 Python  
- 📚 Pandas, NumPy  
- 📉 yFinance, Statsmodels  
- 📈 Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly  
- 📊 Facebook Prophet / ARIMA (Optional)  
- 📁 Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📁 Dataset

- Source: [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/) using `yfinance` API  
- Company: _e.g., TCS, Infosys, Apple Inc._  
- Data Range: _e.g., Jan 2015 – Dec 2023_  
- Frequency: Daily closing prices

## 📌 Key Steps

1. **Data Extraction**
   - Fetched historical stock prices using `yfinance` for selected companies.

2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**
   - Handled missing values
   - Converted date columns
   - Calculated daily returns, moving averages, volatility

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Trend lines, candlestick charts
   - Price comparisons over years
   - Seasonal decomposition

4. **Forecasting Models**
   - Implemented ARIMA / Prophet for forecasting future trends
   - Visualized confidence intervals

5. **Evaluation**
   - Compared predicted vs actual prices
   - Calculated RMSE / MAE for forecasting models

## ✅ Outcomes

- Identified long-term growth trends and market corrections  
- Detected seasonality and volatility in selected stocks  
- Forecasted 6–12 months of stock price behavior  
- Built reusable Python pipeline for any listed company
